#  Invasive Water Hyacinth Project
A project to identify invasive water hyacinth through satellite imagery layered onto a mapping interface

## About
This project will take satellite imagery (sentinel) from the satellite host and then pre-process it using an API before being fed into an algorithm for post-processing
and outputting to a shape file. This shapefile would then be uploaded to a webmap for visual overlay display. This process would consist of converting the shapefile to a GeoJSON and then combining
with exisiting GeoJSON files to create an overlay which can be switched on or off on the webmap.
